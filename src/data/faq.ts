        question: "How many lineups should I learn at X rank?",
        answer: "However many you want. Really there is no magic number. The lineups on this site per map are grouped by what area they scan, usually the easiest for that area being tagged as essential.<br><br>It is recommended to **at least learn all of the lineups tagged as essential** for every map. This may seem like a lot at first so just learn a handful of lineups every day and enjoy the game while you do it. I personally started out only knowing lineups for Ascent, hoping that my next game would be on Ascent. Whenever it wasn't Ascent I'd quickly look up 2-3 lineups at the start and after the halfway switch. Soon enough I had lineups for every map. You can get away with only knowing 1 lineup for a bomb site but your enemies will quickly shoot your dart the moment it lands if you keep repeating the same lineup. So here's some general guidelines:<br><br>**When starting out**, I'd say knowing about 2 lineups per side (attackers and defenders) for every bomb site and middle point, is a good place to start for climbing in ranked.<br><br>**The higher you climb** the more you can focus on lineups for specific situations, like learning lineups for clearing specific angles, while also expanding your arsenal for every bomb site<br><br>**The end goal** of course would be to learn all the lineups on this site, and then to create a couple of your own if you want even more.<br><br>As of right now (January 2023) Shock Darts aren't very powerful, dealing 75 damage max but only if you hit them dead center... But if you get to this point you should start learning shock darts for all common bomb plant spots and maybe even ult orbs. This site might host shockdarts in the future but as of right now we are just focusing on recon darts"

        question: "What is considered a good dart?",
        answer: "Good darts need to be easily **repeatable**, while giving **reliable** data and **maximizing** the amount of angles it clears. **All while not being easy to hide from or destroy.**<br><br>A lot of stress on those last two because for a lot of darts, as soon as they land, the defender is hiding in a spot where they can just move around a corner and completely avoid it. Worse even, a lot of darts land in spots that can easily be shot without needing major aim adjustments. Darts with long travel times (especially ones that travel behind them) can preoccupy the enemy longer than shorter arrows, giving you time to potentially peek/ push them if they are distracted. The downsides to long travel time is that it can immediately be shot on impact, but at least you can have a general idea on where they are.<br><br>A good dart should also rely more on lining up the crosshair over the HUD. That being said, there are many great darts that make use of the HUD, but they are subject to change since we have no idea how / when Riot will change the HUD. (though Riot has tried to change Sova's animations before and after lot's of outrage reverted their change to preserve lineups)"

        question: "What does green, yellow and red mean on the map for each lineup?",
        answer: "**Green** means it scans the area and will reliably reveal enemies given how players naturally play/hold angles.<br><br>**Yellow** means it scan the area, but it's not reliable since the average person with reactions will hear/see the dart, and lose line of sight easily. Of course it can scan someone who's distracted, has slow reactions, or not paying attention, but this uncertainty that is dependent on how the enemy plays, is why it's yellow. <br><br>**Red** means it's does not scan that spot, and you need to check the spot when pushing, or tell your teammates where they could be so you aren't baiting them.<br><br> In short, green is good, yellow and red means be careful. If someone's scanned in a yellow spot, it's a suprise, but a welcome one. "

        question: "What determines if a dart is Easy, Medium or Hard?",
        answer: "**Easy** means the dart isn't very precise and can be done with almost no effort<br><br>**Medium** means the dart requires you to properly hit the lineup but it's easy enough to do with an easy reference point<br><br>**Hard** means the dart's lineup is either very precise or requires you to draw mental lines to reference points<br><br>In short, Learn the Easy & Medium ones and after that try the Hard ones if you feel like it. In general you should use the lineup in a custom game to remember it rather than just look at it here. The best way to learn something is to actually do that thing ;)"

        question: "Do these darts work on all setups?",
        answer: "We can't answer that question for every computer and resolution, but if you're on a **1080p** or better monitor, it should work. In general most darts don't rely on pixel perfect placements. If a dart positions you in a corner, and lines up with the crosshair, and not the HUD, it should work for you. There are a couple darts that require material quality to be set to 'medium' for things like leaves. It's highly recommended to set your material quality to medium, but if you're on a lower end computer, you can set it to low and skip those darts or find other elements to line up with"

        question: "How frequently will you update this site?",
        answer: "The plan is to update this site whenever more darts are found, or when Riot makes a UI change where a dart needs to be removed. You can find out if any changes have been made here in the logs. That said, this site is maintained by unpaid volunteers, so we can't guarantee that we will be able to update it as frequently as we would like. That said, there are already plenty of darts for every map so missing a couple won't hold you back from dominating your enemies."

        question: "I have a sick dart, can I show you and showcase it here?",
        answer: "Of course, you can, if it meets the criteria above, feel free to send a screenshots of the location of where it lands, as well as how it lines up, to **EmilyTheFox#3720** on Discord. I would love to add your dart and credit you in the info."

    {
        question: "There's a bug on your site, is there a way I can tell you?",
        answer: "I would highly appreciate it if you contact me on Discord at **EmilyTheFox#3720** regarding it! I don't normally work in React.js, and I thought it would be a fun project for me. Thank you for reporting issues!"
