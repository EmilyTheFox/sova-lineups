# SovaLineups (A Valorant website)

This site is a hobby project, it's goal being to both teach everyone helping in development about making apps in React and teaching visitors about important Sova lineups in RiotGame's Valorant.
The site is build using React and TypeScript, other than those this project is very conservative about adding new tools as to not overcomplicate what is in nature a simple website documenting some player ideas

# Demo

## Live Site: [SovaLineups.com](https://sovalineups.com/)
## Example Image:

## General Use

The site is meant to be very simple to use. Teaching it's users new lineups in a couple steps
1. Select which map you want to learn Sova lineups for by either selecting a map in the navigation dropdown or by clicking the map's icon at the bottom of the home page
2. Look for a lineup you want to learn and click on it
3. Read the text, look at the images and if desired watch the short under 30 second long video of us executing the lineup in game

## Roadmap

December 2022: Launch the rework of the site, having Emily pick up the development where Brandon Joe left it. The goal at this time is simply to refactor the entire website without adding much new content
January 2023: Improve the QoL of the site, (fixing issues if they are still present after the refactor) like not being able to directly go to maps from the URL, not being able to unselect filters and mobile responsiveness
February 2023: Add more content to the site, goal being 30-50 lineups for each of the 8 (or however many at the time) maps, ordered in a logical way to learn them and being fully filterable on tags & name
March 2023: Add a minimap similar to the one shown in game when pressing M, with each lineup marked on it, so a user can easily find lineups for the spots they want to add to their arsenal of lineups

## Credits

Credit where credit is due, this project is possible because of two people.

Brandon Joe, an amazing front-end developer who came up with the idea, made the original site's code and is still responsible for most of the design. Without Brandon this site would've never existed. You can find Brandon's work at https://brandonjoe.com/  
&\
EmilyTheFox#3720, a back-end developer who's usually focused on PHP & C# but came across this website while playing Valorant and wanted to breathe new live into it by the end of 2022 after seeing the site hadn't been updated for 2 years

## React Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
